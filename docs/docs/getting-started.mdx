# Get started

This guide will walk you through the steps needed to set up your Onju Voice PCB with ESPHome. You'll go through the steps of replacing the PCB in the Google Nest mini V2, installing the necessary software, and configuring the settings to get everything up and running smoothly.

_Make sure this page is opened in a Chromium-based browser on a desktop. The software installation does not work with a tablet or phone._

:::note
If your device does not appear in the list, make sure you are using a USB data cable (i.e., not power-only), and try installing the [driver](https://www.silabs.com/developers/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers?tab=downloads) for the serial chip.
:::

1. Press the blue **connect** button below, a pop-up window will appear with a list of available USB devices.
2. Hold down the `BOOT` button on the Onju Voice PCB ans connect a USB cable.
    - _Note_: this prevents the device from reconnecting repeatedly.
3. In the pop-up window, a new entry should appear. Select this USB serial port and click **Connect**.
4. Choose **Install Onju Voice Satellite**, then click **Install**.
5. After installation, click **Next**.
    - _Note_: since the device is still in BOOT mode, you'll return to a previous pop-up window.
6. Refresh the browser page.
7. Press the `RST` button on the Onju Voice PCB and repeat steps 1 and 3 to reconnect to the device.
8. In the pop-up window, choose **Connect to Wi-Fi**.
    - Add the Onju Voice Satellite to your Wi-Fi network:
      - Select your network from the list and enter the credentials for your 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi network.

    - This opens the **My** link to Home Assistant (see image below).
      - If you have not used My Home Assistant before, you will need to configure it. If your Home Assistant URL is not accessible on `http://homeassistant.local:8123`, replace it with the URL to your Home Assistant instance.
2. Click on **Open the link**.
3. It opens your Home Assistant instance and asks you to set up, click **OK**.
4. Congratulations ðŸŽ‰ You have successfully added the Onju Voice Satellite to your Home Assistant instance.

2. Click on **Configure**, at the discovered device.
3. It asks if you want to add the device and click **Submit**.
